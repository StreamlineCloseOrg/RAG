## 1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio
### Step 1: Go to the Visual Studio Code Website
Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). Go to the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/.
### Step 2: Download Visual Studio Code
On the homepage, you will see a "Download for Windows" button. Click this button.
If you're using Windows, the website will automatically detect your OS and suggest the correct download.
If you're using macOS or Linux, select the appropriate version for your system (Intel, ARM64, etc.).
The download should start automatically. If not, you can click the provided link to manually start the download.
### Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code on Windows
Once the download is complete, open the downloaded file (e.g., VSCodeUserSetup-x64.exe).
The installer will launch. Follow these steps:
Agree to the License Agreement: Click "I accept the agreement" and then click "Next."
Choose the installation location: The default location is fine, but you can change it if you prefer.
Select additional tasks:
Itâ€™s recommended to check options like "Add to PATH" for easier access.
You can also choose to create a desktop icon for quick access.
Click "Next" and then "Install."
Once installation is complete, click "Finish" to launch Visual Studio Code.

## 2. Install Python Programming Language
### Step 1: Install Python
Go to the Python website: Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Download the latest version of Python: The website should automatically detect your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). Click the "Download Python" button for your platform.
Open the downloaded .exe file.
Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH". This is crucial as it allows you to run Python from the command line.
Click "Install Now."
### Step 2: Install Python Extension in VS Code
Open VS Code.
Install the Python extension:
Click on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+X (macOS).
Search for Python in the Extensions Marketplace.
Install the extension from Microsoft (it should have high ratings).
